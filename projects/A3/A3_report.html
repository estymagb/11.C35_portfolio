				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Visualization uses clock-like movement and understanding as month/time axes for data.</li>
				<li>The number of cases tends to ween during the summer moonths, but rapidly increases towards the fall.</li>
				<li>The winter of 2021 and 2022 seem to be where 7-day average cases accumulate the most.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				I would like to focus my critique on communication and forced assumptions. In this
				visualization, one could draw from its annotation and relative timeline that the analyst wish to
				draw attention to the number of Covid-19 cases occuring since March 2020, ending its timeline in
				Jan 2022. The spiral of data points runs alongside the message of the pandemic, "spiraling out of control",
				which is an enticing way to display data in a op-ed. Using red, a color often pointing to blood and the
				life of humans, depicts the real fear of Covid-19: death. Indicating the '7-day average' of cases
				also keeps the reader informed.

			</p>

				<p>
				However, some areas of this visualization loses in readability.
				Points are considered with three variables (month, year, case amount), yet this second variable is
				reliant on annotated notes, indicating where the year would start. This understanding is helpful for
				those who use the Gregorian calendar, but could be confusing otherwise. Additionally the graph is
				not centered--one could some additional data is being presented despite the nonconformity. Arcs describing
				the fall months are technically larger than the winter/spring ones, what was the reason for that?
				The legend explain how size is meant to indicate a number of cases, yet the scale is not easily interpretable.
				Miscommunication between audience members trying to understand trend of Covid-19 cases is what this
				visualization thrives at, causing it to ultimately fail at its function.

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

			<p>
        DESCRIBE YOUR RATIONALE TO JUSTIFY THE DECISIONS FOR YOUR FINAL DESIGN.
				WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO CONVEY, AND HOW DOES YOUR DESIGN FACILITATE THIS?
      </p>

			<p>
        REFLECT ON HOW YOUR FINAL DESIGN DOES OR DOES NOT ADDRESS YOUR ORIGINAL CRITIQUE.
				WHAT TENSIONS OR TRADEOFFS DID YOU ENCOUNTER? WHAT DID NOT WORK OUT AS ANTICIPATED?
