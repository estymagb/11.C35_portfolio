			<h2>Subtheme: Transit-Oriented Development</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What are typical demographics of public transit users?</li>
				<li>What benefits are there to transit-oriented development?</li>
				<li>How does transit-oriented development affect accesibility?</li>
				<li>Why are some subdivisions not complying with the <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/09/mbta-communities-act-zoning-map">MBTA Communities Act</a>?</li>
			</ol>
			<h4><u>Motivations:</u> Transit-Oriented Development is currently my career interest as an 11-6,
				so most of these questions are based in previous coursework, research and/or my own curiousity.</h4>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="visuals/MBTA Transit Fleet Count.png" alt="Polygon size proportion graph depicting the total amount of MBTA routes by transit type." />
				<figcaption>
				Let us first define the situation of TOD in Boston. We will calculate the amount of total MBTA routes grouped by transit type, to determine
				how the MBTA approaches TOD. To clarify our findings, I think its important to note that all routes have Agency IDs of Cape Cod Flyer
				Authority, which only owns one orute in joint collaboration with the MBTA: Boston to Cape Cod weekend/holiday train. Additionally, this route
				has mulitple duplicates within itself, so it was also important to to count by distinct route as well. From the graph, it seems like the MBTA
				prioritized rail replacement bus services the most-- however this service is typically meant to a subsitute for maintenance on rapid/rail transit.
				Local bus is actually the highest normal running service here-- showing how rail allows one to travel farther distances, while buses' roles are
				to get passangers to the right location. Does this rail replacement quantity indicate many safety measures-- or frequent maintenance/delays?

				<img src="visuals/public transit commuters.png" alt="Two graphs, comparing Ridership by car and transit in 2014 to 2024. POV dominates work travel, but both have seen a decline in the last 10 years." />
				<figcaption>
				While understanding the framework of the MBTA, it's important to know <i>who</i> is utilizing the MBTA too. In the figure, while its apparent
				many people use MBTA/other authority services to commute on a daily basis to work, car ridership is heavily favored. It's also important to
				note that ridership for both car and public transit has descreased-- most likely due to an uptick of work-from-home positions resulting
				from the CoVID pandemic. However, Middlesex County, location of the Boston metropolitan, seems to have the largest amount of users--
				does this ridership quantity directly tie to accesibility, specificially, proximity?

				<img src="visuals/rapid transit_wheelchair_access.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				To determine the beneficiaries of MBTA, we explore the amount of accessible stations each major rail transit. To manuever
				this graph, non-terminal routes had their duplicates removed (via Stop_Id; as inbound and outbound) to count wheelchair access stations once.
				Most stations have wheelchair access, except for the Green Line. This discrepancy points to tram/outside stations having lower accessibility.
				Additionally, to find percent of wheelchair stations, usage of field indicators (wheelchair=1) and quotient
				between count and total stations was determined too. This describes general upkeep by the MBTA, to ensure TOD is for any type physical body,
				but how does accessibility frame to location proximity? Let's discover more.

			<figure>
				<img src="visuals/Non Compliant MBTA communities.png" alt="Visual depicting non-compliant communities having little access to MBTA transit." />
				<figcaption>
				<p>In this first figure, I used quantitative data to predict these communities' reasoning for not abiding to MBTA policy.
				I focused on rapid transit such as frequent bus (1 every fifteen minutes as outlined by the MBTA), commuter and subway rail, their most reliable services.
				The number of transit services within a two-mile radius of these cities is described in a deepening scale of blue.
				</p>
				<p>Bordered by red, most of these non-compliant communities are not located in relative reach of current MBTA rapid transit. This could indicate
				cost-effect to abide by MBTA policy is not worth the effort of increasing family/afforable housing.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p> In this exploration, refreshing the idea of transit-oriented development and its different factors at play-- accesibility, demographic,
				location proximity, and method. These factors all frame the current situation around growing transit-oriented development in Boston,
				Massachusetts and the United States. I found it interesting how much fail-safe methods the MBTA has in-store for the rail transit, making up
				the largest quantity of MBTA fleet types as shown in figure 1. Additionally, while infrastructure is something well-established by the MBTA,
				they must focus on perspective-- that is, convincing communities in future-planned route proximity, they will benefit from the development.
				If not, NIMBYism is a terrible drug, which can refute TOD benefits meant for the most vulnerable.
